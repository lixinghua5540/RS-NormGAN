Li, "RS-NormGAN: Enhancing change detection of multi-temporal optical remote sensing images through effective radiometric normalization," ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, vol. 221, pp. 324-346, 2025. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2025.02.005.<br>
We proposed a pseudo invariant feature (PIF) - inspired weakly supervised generative adversarial network (GAN) for remote sensing images radiometric normalization, which is beneficial for applications.
